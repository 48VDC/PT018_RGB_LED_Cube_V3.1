# PT018_RGB_LED_Cube_V3.1
RGB LED Cube 4x4x4 aka. Charliecube

This project actually a remake of Asher Glick's Charliecube. His original version is well documented at https://aglick.com/charliecube.html and his original code can be checked at https://github.com/AsherGlick/Charliecube

I made the custom board and kits for this project, based on his works. 
At this version I remove the softlatch circuit and try to use Sleep fitur with it.
